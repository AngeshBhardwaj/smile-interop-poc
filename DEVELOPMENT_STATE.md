## üîí **CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:**

### PII/PHI Data Handling (SAVED IN CLAUDE.md)
- **HIPAA Compliance**: All patient health information must be properly encrypted and masked
- **GDPR Compliance**: Personal data must be anonymized/pseudonymized in logs and events
- **Data Masking**: Implement field-level masking for sensitive data in CloudEvents
- **Audit Logging**: Track all access to PII/PHI data with immutable audit trails
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Redaction**: Automatically redact PII/PHI from logs, traces, and monitoring systems

### Security Implementation Notes:
- Use data masking utilities in @smile/common for consistent PII/PHI handling
- Implement separate event schemas for internal (full data) vs external (masked data) events
- Apply security headers and authentication for all health-related endpoints
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments required

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:**

### Dual App Services Architecture:
```
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ health-service/          # PII/PHI compliant health events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orders-service/          # Business logistics events (Step 2b)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interop-layer/          # Event routing and mediation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ client-service/         # Event consumption

packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/                 # Security utilities, masking, audit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cloud-events/          # Event handling with security
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openhim-adapter/       # Health interop compliance
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:**

### Established Practices:
1. **One step at a time** - Complete development, run tests, validate, commit
2. **No skipping steps/milestones** - User validation required
3. **No rush** - Quality and security over speed
4. **Commit strategy**: Logical milestones with detailed commit messages
5. **Build verification**: `make quick-check` before each milestone
6. **Quality standards**: No compromise on security or code quality

### Current Build Status:
- ‚úÖ All packages build successfully
- ‚úÖ Linting passes (only acceptable warnings remain)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation clean
- ‚úÖ Security utilities fully functional

   - Orders domain events (supply orders, equipment requests, inventory)
   - Business-focused events without PII/PHI concerns
   - REST endpoints for order management workflows
   - Swagger documentation for order APIs
   - Unit tests for order processing logic

2. **Step 3: Implement CloudEvent Consumer in Interop Layer**

- Each channel configured to route to specific mediator service
- Mediators perform data transformation (Structure A ‚Üí Structure B)
- Transformation happens in mediator, not in OpenHIM or Interop-layer

**Planning Documents Created:**
- PHASE_3_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md ‚úÖ
- TESTING_VALIDATION_PLAN.md (Phase 2) ‚úÖ
- POC architecture diagram reviewed ‚úÖ

**NEXT ACTION**: Begin Phase 3a - Pass-Through Mediator Implementation

**Phase 3b**: Adapter Mediator (Transformation) ‚Üí Demonstrate data restructuring
**Phase 3c**: Orchestrator Mediator (Complex) ‚Üí Show multi-system orchestration

**End Goal**: Complete POC demonstrating OpenHIM interoperability capabilities with all 3 mediator types working in a real event-driven architecture.
