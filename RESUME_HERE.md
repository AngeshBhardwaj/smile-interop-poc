4. ‚úÖ **OpenHIM Integration**: Full transparency and transaction logging
5. ‚úÖ **Test Data**: Order ID 8d3325fa-23fe-48f6-bb13-016c00387296, Transaction ID 68f8d6771e6989320731a01f

### What To Do Next
```bash
# DECISION REQUIRED: Choose architectural path before proceeding
#
# Option A: Single Mediator with Multi-Client Fan-Out (12-18 hours)
# - See MULTI_CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
#
# Option B: Separate Mediator Services with OpenHIM Routes (~6 hours) - RECOMMENDED
# - See REFACTORING_PLAN.md
#
# Once you choose, implementation can begin immediately
```

## üìã ARCHITECTURAL DECISION GUIDE

### Option A: Single Mediator with Multi-Client Fan-Out
**When to Choose**: If you prefer simplicity and don't need OpenHIM transaction transparency

**Architecture**:
```
OpenHIM Channel "/transform"
  ‚Üì
transformation-mediator (enhanced)
  ‚îú‚îÄ FHIR transformation ‚Üí POST 3201
  ‚îú‚îÄ HL7 transformation  ‚Üí POST 3202
  ‚îî‚îÄ Custom transformation ‚Üí POST 3203
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Simpler - Keep single mediator service
- ‚úÖ Configuration-driven - Add clients via clients.config.json
- ‚úÖ No code changes to add new clients
- ‚úÖ Fewer services to manage

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå OpenHIM sees only 1 transaction
- ‚ùå No per-client visibility in OpenHIM
- ‚ùå Fan-out logic hidden from audit trail
- ‚ùå Defeats some OpenHIM transparency benefits

**Timeline**: 12-18 hours
**Full Plan**: See `MULTI_CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

---

### Option B: Separate Mediator Services with OpenHIM Routes (RECOMMENDED)
**When to Choose**: If you need full transparency, audit trails, and OpenHIM native patterns

**Architecture**:
```
OpenHIM Channel "/transform"
  ‚îú‚îÄ Route 1: fhir-transformation-mediator:3301
  ‚îú‚îÄ Route 2: hl7-transformation-mediator:3302
  ‚îî‚îÄ Route 3: custom-transformation-mediator:3303
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Full transparency - OpenHIM shows all 3 routes
- ‚úÖ Per-client metrics - Independent success/failure tracking
- ‚úÖ Native OpenHIM pattern - Proper orchestration
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail - Full visibility for compliance
- ‚úÖ Easy to add clients - Just add new route to channel
- ‚úÖ Better scaling - Each mediator scales independently

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå More services (3 instead of 1)
- ‚ùå Slightly more complex setup
- ‚ùå Need to create shared utility package

**Timeline**: ~6 hours
**Full Plan**: See `REFACTORING_PLAN.md`

---

### How to Decide
**Choose A if**:
- You want fastest implementation
- You don't need OpenHIM audit trail transparency
- You prefer fewer services to manage

**Choose B if**:
- You need full audit trail (compliance requirement)
- You want OpenHIM native patterns
- You need per-client metrics
- You expect to scale clients independently

## üéØ NEXT TASK: Choose Architecture & Begin Implementation

**Status**: Ready to implement - waiting for user decision

### What Has Been Completed
‚úÖ Custom-transformation-mediator working end-to-end
‚úÖ OpenHIM channel creation automated
‚úÖ E2E test successful with warehouse client
‚úÖ All core components validated

### What Needs Decision
Choose between Option A or Option B based on your requirements:

**Option A (MULTI_CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)**:
- Single transformation-mediator with multi-client fan-out
- 12-18 hours to implement
- Configuration-driven client management
- Simpler but less transparent

**Option B (REFACTORING_PLAN.md)** - RECOMMENDED:
- 3 separate mediator services (FHIR, HL7, Custom)
- ~6 hours to implement
- Full OpenHIM orchestration and audit trail
- Better scalability and compliance

### Next Steps (After Decision)
1. **Decision**: Choose Option A or B
2. **Review**: Read the detailed implementation plan
3. **Plan**: Create TodoList for the chosen approach
4. **Implement**: Start implementation phase by phase
5. **Test**: Validate each phase before moving forward
6. **Update**: Keep DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md updated
7. **Commit**: Logical commits at each milestone

## üí° CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANT

### What Was Decided
**Question**: How to handle 3 clients needing order data in different formats?

**Answer**: Single Mediator with Multi-Client Fan-Out (Option C)
- Single transformation-mediator service
- Configuration-driven client management
- Fan-out to multiple clients from single event
- Each client gets data in their specific format

**Why This Approach**:
- ‚úÖ Scalable (100+ clients)
- ‚úÖ Configuration-driven (no code changes to add clients)
- ‚úÖ Industry standard pattern
- ‚úÖ Centralized management

### What Was Fixed
1. **Routing Issue**: All events were going to `/smile-default`
2. **Solution**: Updated docker-compose.yml environment variables:
   ```yaml
   OPENHIM_HEALTH_ENDPOINT: "https://openhim-core:5000/passthrough"
   OPENHIM_ORDERS_ENDPOINT: "https://openhim-core:5000/transform"
   ```
3. **Status**: Service restarted, ready to test

### What's Next
1. Validate new routing works (30 min testing)
2. Implement multi-client support (12-18 hours)
3. Follow plan in `MULTI_CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## üìù COMMIT CHECKLIST

Before committing multi-client changes:
- [ ] All 3 transformation rules created and tested
- [ ] All 3 mock clients created and running
- [ ] clients.config.json validated
- [ ] E2E test showing fan-out to all 3 clients
- [ ] Transaction in OpenHIM shows all 6 orchestrations
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md updated

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

You'll know multi-client implementation is complete when:
1. Single order event triggers transformations for all 3 clients
2. Hospital receives FHIR R4 format
3. Pharmacy receives HL7 v2 format
4. Warehouse receives custom JSON format
5. OpenHIM transaction shows:
   - Transform for Client A
   - Forward to Client A
   - Transform for Client B
   - Forward to Client B
   - Transform for Client C
   - Forward to Client C
6. All clients return 200 OK
7. Configuration-driven: Can add 4th client without code changes

---

## üö® IMPORTANT REMINDERS

From `CLAUDE.md`:
1. **No rush** - Quality over speed
2. **Test each step** - Validate before moving forward
3. **One step at a time** - Complete, test, commit
4. **Build verification** - Ensure everything compiles
5. **Commit at milestones** - Logical checkpoints
