### üìã **PENDING STEPS:**

#### Step 2b: Create Orders App Service for logistics events - PENDING
- Orders domain events (supply orders, equipment requests, inventory)
- Business-focused events without PII/PHI concerns
- REST endpoints for order management workflows
- Swagger documentation for order APIs
- Unit tests for order processing logic

#### Step 3: Implement CloudEvent Consumer in Interop Layer - PENDING
#### Step 4: Add Environment Configuration - PENDING
#### Step 5: Create Integration Tests with security validation - PENDING
#### Step 6: Add Observability with PII/PHI redaction - PENDING

## üîí **CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:**

### PII/PHI Data Handling (SAVED IN CLAUDE.md)
- **HIPAA Compliance**: All patient health information must be properly encrypted and masked
- **GDPR Compliance**: Personal data must be anonymized/pseudonymized in logs and events
- **Data Masking**: Implement field-level masking for sensitive data in CloudEvents
- **Audit Logging**: Track all access to PII/PHI data with immutable audit trails
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Redaction**: Automatically redact PII/PHI from logs, traces, and monitoring systems

### Security Implementation Notes:
- Use data masking utilities in @smile/common for consistent PII/PHI handling
- Implement separate event schemas for internal (full data) vs external (masked data) events
- Apply security headers and authentication for all health-related endpoints
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments required

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:**

### Dual App Services Architecture:
```
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ health-service/          # PII/PHI compliant health events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orders-service/          # Business logistics events (Step 2b)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interop-layer/          # Event routing and mediation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ client-service/         # Event consumption

packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/                 # Security utilities, masking, audit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cloud-events/          # Event handling with security
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openhim-adapter/       # Health interop compliance
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:**

### Established Practices:
1. **One step at a time** - Complete development, run tests, validate, commit
2. **No skipping steps/milestones** - User validation required
3. **No rush** - Quality and security over speed
4. **Commit strategy**: Logical milestones with detailed commit messages
5. **Build verification**: `make quick-check` before each milestone
6. **Quality standards**: No compromise on security or code quality

### Current Build Status:
- ‚úÖ All packages build successfully
- ‚úÖ Linting passes (only acceptable warnings remain)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation clean
- ‚úÖ Security utilities fully functional
